TEST TO LOCALHOST:7001

==========================
        DESCRIPTION
==========================
Here we have performed a test over an apache server running
on the port 7001 of the apache container we were given.

It uses the default TLS configuration, so no alert related to this would be shown.  

It uses a certificate that has no weaknesses:
cert1 (RSA 2048):
  subject=C = ES, ST = Malaga, L = Huelin, O = BoqueronSL, CN = localhost
  issuer=C = ES, ST = Malaga, L = Huelin, O = BoqueronCA, CN = my trusted boqueron ca        
  notBefore=Nov 16 19:59:46 2025 GMT
  notAfter=May 15 19:59:46 2026 GMT
  Extensions:
    X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: 
        DNS:localhost, DNS:www.secure.example.com
    X509v3 Key Usage:
        Digital Signature, Key Encipherment
    X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
        TLS Web Server Authentication

But has it is running on localhost, a non_qualified_host alert will be shown.
